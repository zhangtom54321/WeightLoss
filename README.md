# [WeightLoss](https://zhangtom54321.github.io/WeightLoss/)

A website developed for CUHacks 2016. The main feature of the website is the automatic fitness partner pairing. When a user enters their info under the "Find a Partner" section, their information is sent to a database. When two people who live in the same city enter their info, emails are automatically sent to both users' emails, containing the contact info of their partner.<br />

Created using BootStrap framework.
